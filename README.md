LibD: Scalable and Precise Third-party Library Detection in Android Markets


This Project has the following contributions:  
First, it provides a novel Android third-party libraries detection tool, LibD.  
Second, it contains a library list that we have found in our research.  
Third, it contains the experimental results in our evaluation.   

### File list:  
	./groundtruth/*: the groundtruth libraries, LibD detection results, and LibRader detection results for the 1,000 sample apps in Section IV-C.  
	./liblist/*: the libraries lists with different thresholds which vary from 10 to 50 in Section IV-B.   
	./multi-package_libs_instances: the multi-package library instances evaluated in Section IV-F.  
	./tool/*: a stand-alone version of LibD (version 0.0.1).
